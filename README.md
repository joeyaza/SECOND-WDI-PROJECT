# SECOND-WDI-PROJECT

H A P P Y 


A pinterest / tumblr / flickr like photo app focused on travelling / holidays.

The ethos of the app is for like minded people to come together and post pictures of travelling experiences they have enjoyed and others to come on the site and view there experiences.

the layout has somewhat adopted from Pinterest and gives users the opportunity to either upload a picture or link one from somewhere else on the web. The pictures are grouped by places, giving users the chance to comment on the pictures and also like them.

the idea is not to upload many pictures, as for instance facebook but to upload a single snap shot of your experience somewhere.
